# WSDM2025
This is a repository with supporting materials and code for our paper at WSDM2025.

The repository includes the following items:
- The tags of the darknet websites we excluded when constructing the darknet websites dataset (darknet-websites-excluded-tags.txt).
- The code of the analysis from the most frequent words. The code identifies the most frequent words among the data items (from the ''train dataset'') that are matched vs. not matched by our CTI dictionary (comp_words_relevant_vs_not.ipynb). We report these for transparency, i.e. showcasing that we have objectively fine-tuned our dictionary.
- The topic model parameters from our experiments (topic-model-parameter-experiments.xlsx).
- The word clouds and the respective topic labels that we manually reviewed based on the suggestion of LLAMA-2 (to be added).
- The code for data preprocessing, the keyword dictionary, and the code for the topic model(to be added).
- The detailed classified related work list (to be added).
- The search query from the literature review (literature-review-search-query.txt).
